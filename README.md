# 4's Movement

A Minecraft mod using Quilt that adds several exciting movement options to the game like double jumps and aerial dashes, to make navigating and exploring more fun.

## Features
* By default, players can now double jump by pressing space while in the air. (Except when wearing an elytra.)
* The new enchantments Triple Jump I and II, applicable to boots, allows you to triple and quadruple jump respectively.
* You can perform a higher standing jump, called a lunge, by sneaking, standing up and quickly jumping. Think of it as bending through your knees to get a more powerful jump out.
* Lunges can also be performed with airjumps. How does that work, you ask? It's an airjump, we're past the point of realism complaints, aren't we?
* Similarly, sneaking right when landing slightly decreases fall damage, as if you're trying to dampen the landing. Most effective on small falls, to compensate for the fact that you can now jump 4 blocks high with no external help.
* And lastly, the very powerful Airdash enchantment.

Airdash can be combined with Triple Jump, and replaces all your aerial jumps with powerful dashes in the direction the player is facing. The controls for that need some explanation though.
If you press space in the air while holding forwards, you will do a full dash, moving a significant distance at high speed.
If you instead do not hold forwards while pressing space, the dash will have less momentum in the looking direction but gain more height, allowing for some more precise dashing.

## Extra: Lower hunger decay
For the sake of encouraging the use of the new jump-related mechanics, especially early game when you don't have a lot of good food, the hunger usage of jumps has been reduced significantly.
This means you can do many more jumps before your hunger runs out, so don't be afraid to use double jumps extensively when exploring a fresh world!
